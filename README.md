# CatsVsDogs-classifier
Hello everyone !!!

This repository is a complete guide to build a simple image classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Please follow these steps, in order to do so : 
## 1. Dataset
I got the dataset for this project from the "Machine Learning A-Z" course on the Udemy platform.
It consists of : 
                <br>Training set - 8000 images (Dogs = 4000, Cats = 4000)
                <br>Test set - 2000 images (Dogs = 1000, Cats = 1000)

## 2. Implementation
I've used Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook for the implementation.
You can install the Anaconda Navigator for your OS from the official website for free. After the installation, you will have to open the Anaconda prompt and run the following commands : 
        pip install tensorflow
        pip install keras
This will install the tensorflow and keras python libraries and then you can start coding by launching the Jupyter Notebook.
Now you can refer the code that I've uploaded in this repo to start with the implementation.
I was successfully able to build a classifier with an accuracy of 86% on the training set and 83% on the test set.
I strongly encourage you to take up the "Machine Learning A-Z" course on the Udemy platform, since it really helped me understand the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks.

Please feel free to make any changes to the code and let me know.
Thank you.
